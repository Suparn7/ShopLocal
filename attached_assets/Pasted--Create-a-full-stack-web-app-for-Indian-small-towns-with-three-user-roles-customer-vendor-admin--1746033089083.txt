"Create a full-stack web app for Indian small towns with three user roles (customer, vendor, admin) using Next.js, Tailwind, and Supabase. Features needed:

Multi-role Auth (Phone OTP + Email):

Customer: Browse shops, place orders

Vendor: Manage inventory/orders (mobile-friendly)

Admin: Approve vendors, manage categories

Geo-Localized Marketplace:

Shop categories (General Store, Jewellery, Pharmacy, etc.)

Location-based filtering (within 5km radius)

Delivery availability toggle

Core Features:

Vendor dashboard with inventory management

Order management system with status tracking (Pending → Dispatched → Delivered)

Customer review system with star ratings

Admin moderation panel with analytics

India-Specific Adaptations:

Multi-language support (Hindi + English)

UPI payment integration

WhatsApp order notifications

GST-compliant billing

Mobile-first responsive design

Tech Stack: Next.js 14 App Router, Supabase (Auth/DB/Storage), ShadCN UI, Zod validation, React Hook Form. Use WebContainers for real-time preview and deploy to Vercel."

Key Market Considerations Embedded:

Localization Strategy:

Language: Implement language toggle for regional accessibility

Payment: UPI integration for frictionless payments (Razorpay/PhonePe APIs)

Notifications: WhatsApp API integration for order updates (critical in India's app ecosystem)

Vendor Onboarding:

Simple KYC flow with document upload (GSTIN/PAN)

Inventory templates for common shop categories

Bulk CSV import for existing product catalogs

Discoverability Features:

"Near Me" sorting with distance indicators

Popular categories carousel (pre-seeded with common Indian shop types)

Festival-specific promotional banners (Diwali, Holi etc.)

Admin Safeguards:

Vendor verification system

Order dispute resolution panel

Commission rate configuration

Local delivery partner integration hooks

Pro Tips for Bolt.new Implementation:

Phased Prompting (Better than single massive prompt):

First: "Scaffold Next.js 14 app with Supabase auth and 3 role types"

Then: "Add vendor dashboard with inventory CRUD operations"

Finally: "Implement location filter using PostGIS and 5km radius"

Precision Add-ons:

"Use react-google-maps for location selection"

"Implement optimistic UI updates for order status changes"

"Add dark mode toggle with system preference detection"

Post-Build Enhancements:

"Generate API documentation using Swagger"

"Add Lighthouse CI integration for performance tracking"

"Implement error tracking with Sentry"
